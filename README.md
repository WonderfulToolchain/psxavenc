# psxavenc

psxavenc is an open-source command-line tool for encoding audio and video data
into formats commonly used on the original PlayStation and PlayStation 2.

## Installation

Requirements:

- a recent version of FFmpeg libraries (`libavformat`, `libavcodec`,
  `libavutil`, `libswresample`, `libswscale`);
- a recent version of Meson.

```shell
$ meson setup build
$ meson compile -C build
$ meson install -C build
```

## Usage

Run `psxavenc -h`.

### Examples

Rescale a video file to â‰¤320x240 pixels (preserving aspect ratio) and encode it
into a 15 fps version 2 .str file with 37800 Hz 4-bit stereo audio and 2352-byte
sectors, meant to be played at 2x CD-ROM speed:

```shell
$ psxavenc -t strcd -v v2 -f 37800 -b 4 -c 2 -s 320x240 -r 15 -x 2 in.mp4 out.str
```

Convert a mono audio sample to 22050 Hz raw SPU-ADPCM data:

```shell
$ psxavenc -t spu -f 22050 in.ogg out.snd
```

Convert a stereo audio file to a 44100 Hz interleaved .vag file with 2048-byte
interleave and loop flags set at the end of each interleaved chunk:

```shell
$ psxavenc -t vagi -f 44100 -c 2 -L -i 2048 in.wav out.vag
```

## Supported output formats

The output format must be set using the `-t` option.

| Format   | Audio codec          | Audio channels | Video codec   | Sector size |
| :------- | :------------------- | :------------- | :------------ | :---------- |
| `xa`     | XA-ADPCM             | 1 or 2         |               | 2336 bytes  |
| `xacd`   | XA-ADPCM             | 1 or 2         |               | 2352 bytes  |
| `spu`    | SPU-ADPCM            | 1              |               |             |
| `vag`    | SPU-ADPCM            | 1              |               |             |
| `spui`   | SPU-ADPCM            | Any            |               |             |
| `vagi`   | SPU-ADPCM            | Any            |               |             |
| `str`    | XA-ADPCM (optional)  | 1 or 2         | BS v2/v3/v3dc | 2336 bytes  |
| `strcd`  | XA-ADPCM (optional)  | 1 or 2         | BS v2/v3/v3dc | 2352 bytes  |
| `strspu` | SPU-ADPCM (optional) | Any            | BS v2/v3/v3dc | 2048 bytes  |
| `strv`   |                      |                | BS v2/v3/v3dc | 2048 bytes  |
| `sbs`    |                      |                | BS v2/v3/v3dc |             |

Notes:

- The `xa`, `xacd`, `str` and `strcd` formats will output files with 2336- or
  2352-byte CD-ROM sectors, containing the appropriate CD-XA subheaders and
  dummy EDC/ECC placeholders in addition to the actual sector data. Such files
  **cannot be added to a disc image as-is** and must instead be parsed by an
  authoring tool capable of rebuilding the EDC/ECC data (as it is dependent on
  the file's absolute location on the disc) and generating a Mode 2 CD-ROM image
  with "native" 2352-byte sectors.
- Similarly, files generated with `-t xa` or `-t xacd` **must be interleaved**
  **with other XA-ADPCM tracks or empty padding using an external tool** before
  they can be played.
- `vag` and `vagi` are similar to `spu` and `spui` respectively, but add a .vag
  header at the beginning of the file. The header is always 48 bytes long for
  `vag` files, while in the case of `vagi` files it is padded to the size
  specified using the `-a` option (2048 bytes by default). Note that `vagi`
  files with more than 2 channels and/or alignment other than 2048 bytes are not
  standardized.
- The `strspu` format encodes the input file's audio track as a series of custom
  .str chunks (type ID `0x0001` by default) holding interleaved SPU-ADPCM data
  in the same format as `spui`, rather than XA-ADPCM. As .str chunks do not
  require custom XA subheaders, a file with standard 2048-byte sectors that does
  not need any special handling will be generated.
- The `strv` format disables audio altogether and is equivalent to `strspu` on
  an input file with no audio track.
- The `sbs` format (used in some System 573 games) consists of a series of
  concatenated BS frames, each padded to the size specified by the `-a` option
  (the default setting is 8192 bytes), with no additional headers besides the BS
  frame headers.

## Supported video codecs

All formats with a video track (`str`, `strcd`, `strspu`, `strv` and `sbs`) can
use any of the codecs listed below. The codec can be set using the `-v` option.

| Codec          | Supported by          | Typ. decoder CPU usage |
| :------------- | :-------------------- | :--------------------- |
| `v2` (default) | All players/decoders  | Medium                 |
| `v3`           | Most players/decoders | High                   |
| `v3dc`         | Few players/decoders  | High                   |

Notes:

- The `v3dc` format is a variant of `v3` with a slightly better compression
  ratio, however most tools and playback libraries (including FFmpeg, jPSXdec
  and earlier versions of Sony's own BS decoder) are unable to decode it
  correctly; its use is thus highly discouraged. Refer to
  [the psx-spx section on DC coefficient encoding](https://psx-spx.consoledev.net/cdromfileformats/#dc-v3)
  for more details.
